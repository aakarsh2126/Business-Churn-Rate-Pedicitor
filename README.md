## Artificial Neural Network
The Artifial Neural Network is one of the methods of supervised deep learning where we try to mimic the working of actual human brain cell.We try to find and analyse the output from previous neuron and forward it to next neuron.
## Description
This Neural Network model consists of 11 nodes in input layer,2 hidden layers each with 6 nodes and 1 output layer with 1 node.
The model is trained with 8000 data and is tested in 2000 test data with 83 percent accuracy.
